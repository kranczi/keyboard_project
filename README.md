After a satisfactory results of xkb setup for Linux OS:
https://github.com/kranczi/personal_env
I've had a mixed results when attempting to mirror it for Windows OS.
My private time is spent on a desktop machine with Win OS and I wanted to have a similar experience.

After more research I've finally found a solution that will work accordingly to my requirements and acrossÂ all OS system. That would be a keyboard with qmk firmware on a PCB itself https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware. After investing significant amount of time for choosing the right keyboard supported this project, I can finally list all components for this project:

- 60% mechanical keyboard
- wood case + wood wrist rest
- DZ60 rev3 PCB with USB-C
- Gateron silent brown switches
- Polycarbonate plate
- Cherry stabilizer
- QMK firmware
- Dye-sub keycaps cherry profile + NPKC CMYK

More updates will follow regarding decision making for those components as well as actual layered config for the keyboard. At the time of writing components just got shipped and are on their way.
